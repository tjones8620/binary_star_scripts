# binary_star_scripts

This repository was used for analysis of hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the WR140 colliding wind binary for my research project, as part of my final year studying physics and astrophysics. 
Simulations were undertaken using PION, a fluid dynamics code for modelling HD and MHD, specifically for astrophysical applications.
Visualisation and analysis made use of PyPION, YT, VisIt, matplotlib, etc.

The main aim of this project was to try to explain the nature of WR140's variable X-ray luminosity curve, which deviates from the ideal adiabatic approximation close to the periastron passage, expected to be due to a switch from adiabatic shocks to radiative cooling shocks in this window.
